# MCell

## Overview

MCell (Monte Carlo Cell) development is supported by the NIGMS-funded
(P41GM103712) National Center for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Systems
(MMBioS).

MCell is a program that uses spatially realistic 3D cellular models and
specialized Monte Carlo algorithms to simulate the movements and reactions of
molecules within and between cellsâ€”cellular microphysiology.

* [OSX](https://bintray.com/jczech/mcell/download_file?file_path=mcell-osx-gcc.tgz)

## Build Requirements:

### Ubuntu 16.04:

Run the following commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential bison flex python3-dev swig libboost-all-dev

### Windows

Install the package manager chocolatey from https://chocolatey.org/install.
Follow the instructions listed on that page, which will have you copy a command
into PowerShell as an Administrator.

Once chocolatey is installed, open up a new PowerShell terminal as an
Administrator, and run the following commands:

    choco install -y git
    choco install -y python3
    choco install -y cmake
    choco install -y ninja
    choco install -y msys2
    choco install -y winflexbison
    choco install -y swig
    
Open a new PowerShell Administrator terminal and enter the following:

    msys2

This will open a different MSYS2 terminal (not a PowerShell terminal). In this
MSYS2 terminal, enter the following commands:

    pacman -Syuu
    pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \
                    git subversion mercurial \
                    mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
    pacman -Sy mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-boost

Add CMake and MinGW64 to your [Windows PATH Environment
Variable](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/).
If you have installed these dependencies with Chocolatey and your top level
drive is named `C:`, you can append (or prepend) the following paths into your
Windows PATH:

    C:\tools\msys64\mingw64\bin
    C:\Program Files\CMake\bin

## Building MCell Executable from Source (OSX, Linux, Windows)

Open a terminal (non-Administrator PowerShell for Windows users), clone the
repo and checkout the appropriate branch:

    git clone https://github.com/mcellteam/mcell
    cd mcell
    git checkout nfsim_dynamic_meshes_pymcell

### CMake

If this is your first time cloning the repo, you'll want to do this first:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Next create your build directory and change into it:

    mkdir build
    cd build

#### OSX and Linux

    cmake ..
    make

#### Windows

    cmake -G Ninja ..
    ninja

Note: pyMCell does not currently build on Windows.

## Alternative (non-CMake) Method to Build pyMCell:

PyMCell is an experimental MCell-Python library. You can build it using the
traditional CMake method above or this distutils based method, which requires
swig and a newer version of Python 3 (preferably 3.5 or greater). Run the
following command:

    python3 setupy.py build

## How to Test:

### Testing with nutmeg

[nutmeg](https://github.com/mcellteam/nutmeg) is a regression test
framework for MCell. Installation and usage instructions are listed on the
nutmeg project page.

### Testing MCellR

MCellR testing hasn't been incorporated into nutmeg yet, but you can test
MCellR functionality directly after building MCell. Simply run the following
commands (starting at the top level of the "mcell" project directory):

    python3 -m venv mcell_venv
    source mcell_venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd build
    python mdlr2mdl.py -ni ./fceri_files/fceri.mdlr -o ./fceri_files/fceri -r
